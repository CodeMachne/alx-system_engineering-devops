## Description

The `0x09-web_infrastructure_design` repository contains various tasks and projects aimed at understanding the fundamental concepts of web infrastructure. This includes the design and architecture of servers, load balancers, databases, and more. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of how web services are structured and operate behind the scenes.

## Learning Objectives

By working on this repository, you will learn:

- Different types of web servers and their roles.
- The importance and working of load balancers.
- Database replication and redundancy.
- How to design a scalable and reliable web infrastructure.
- The basics of network security and firewalls.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```markdown
0x09-web_infrastructure_design/
├── 0-simple_web_stack
├── 1-distributed_web_infrastructure
├── 2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure
├── 3-scale_up
└── README.md
```

Each directory contains detailed explanations and diagrams of different web infrastructure setups:

- **0-simple_web_stack**: A basic web stack with a single server.
- **1-distributed_web_infrastructure**: An introduction to distributed web infrastructure with multiple servers.
